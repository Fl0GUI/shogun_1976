# shogun board game(1976)
Shogun is a simple board game where 2 players each have 8 pieces and try to capture the other player's pieces. The rules are simple but the game comes with a twist.



#### From the box:

> In this fame the number on each piece determines how many squares it can move. But watch out! Every time a piece is played the number may change! 
> 
> Combine strategy with luck and suspense as you try to capture your opponent's Shogun.

Read the whole game manual and see the box in the *physical* folder.
