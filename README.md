# shogun board game(1976)
Shogun is a simple board game where 2 players each have 8 pieces and try to capture the other player's pieces. The rules are simple but the game comes with a twist.



#### From the game manual:

The number on a piece changes while it is being moved across the board. The number on the piece before a move is begun dictates the number of squares to be moved. The number showing once the move is completed is valid for the next move with that piece.

Read the whole game manual and see the box in the *physical* folder.
